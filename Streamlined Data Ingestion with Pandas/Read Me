Before you can analyze data, you first have to acquire it. This course teaches you how to build pipelines to import data kept 
in common storage formats. You’ll use pandas, a major Python library for analytics, to get data from a variety of sources, from
spreadsheets of survey responses, to a database of public service requests, to an API for a popular review site. Along the way,
you’ll learn how to fine-tune imports to get only what you need and to address issues like incorrect data types.
Finally, you’ll assemble a custom dataset from a mix of sources.
