********************************************Question Given************************************************************
Using a DataFrame
In the previous exercise, you saw how to split up a task and use the low-level python multiprocessing.Pool API to do calculations on several processing units.

It's essential to understand this on a lower level, but in reality, you'll never use this kind of APIs. A more convenient way to parallelize an apply over several groups is using the dask framework and its abstraction of the pandas DataFrame, for example.

The pandas DataFrame, athlete_events, is available in your workspace.
****************************************************************************************************************************

***************************************Task to complete************************************************************
Print out the mean age for each Year. Remember dask uses lazy evaluation.

Lazy Evaluation Concept:
In a nutshell, lazy evaluation means that the object is evaluated when it is needed, not when it is created.
*******************************************************************************************************************



*********************************************Solution Begins here*****************************************************
import dask.dataframe as dd

# Set the number of pratitions
athlete_events_dask = dd.from_pandas(athlete_events, npartitions = 4)

# Calculate the mean Age per Year
print(athlete_events_dask.groupby('Year').Age.mean().compute())
